# Classification-Project---Customer-Churn
The project is based on predicting the customer churn of a telecommunication company. There are 4 sections and a additional part in this project.

- Defining the Problem
- Data: I investigated the inputs and manage/clean the data for prediction
- Model Evaluation: I set up two (combat proven) machine learning algorithms and test their performances. Afterwards hypertuned the selected model
- Features: I determined the most important features in the prediction. Due to transformation of the data, two similar feature selection analysis is presented.
- Addtional Part: Hypertuning did not provide sufficient imporvement so I got rid of some of the independent variables to reduce the complexity in the model.
